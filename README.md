#Gestalt Lambda

This repository contains a version of the Gestalt Lambda service.  This service provides a RESTful interface to an implementation 
of a lambda engine.  The current adapter work supports running under Mesos as a Mesos Framework.  This allows efficient use of 
hardware resources for one-off or seldomly occuring compute tasks.
